Just download it
========
* If you want to download things from [ecshop bbs](http://bbs.ecshop.com) without leaking your phone number, just try this.
* They encrypted the download link, but I decrypted it. You can have fun with ecshop, shopex software. Ecshop is opensource, but shopex not.
* For example, if you want to download an attachment from site bbs.shop.com but you were redirected to somewhere. Now you just need to 
copy the link and get the encrypted download link using *get_ecshop_link*.

Then you can copy the download link and open/download using any browser.
